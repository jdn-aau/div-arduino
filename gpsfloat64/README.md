# A GPS module for NMEA handling

- NMEA 0183
- GPGGA packages
- on ublox neo 6m and 7m all tx is disabled except for GGA 
-- by use of ublox propritary PUBX messages
- Implementation for Arduino (Mega)
- Tested with two GPS, SW has capability for 3
- Tested with 7h without loosing packages
- Using 64 bit float by use of "fp64lib" works nice
-- 32 bit float is to low in resolution


No guarantee what so ever
